    "\n",
    "   - Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data. It differs in that it can automatically learn features from raw data, whereas traditional machine learning often requires manual feature extraction.\n",

    "2\\. **Can you explain the evolution of neural networks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Neural networks evolved from simple perceptrons in the 1950s to multi-layer perceptrons, and eventually to deep neural networks. Key milestones include the backpropagation algorithm in the 1980s, the rise of CNNs in the 1990s, and the resurgence of deep learning in the 2010s with advances in computational power and data availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Networks\n",

    "\n",
    "5\\. **Explain the role of weights and biases in a neural network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Weights determine the strength of the connection between neurons, and biases allow the activation function to be shifted, enabling better fitting of the model to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "6\\. **What is forward propagation in neural networks?**\n",
